## üîÅ 1. CI/CD Pipeline with Azure DevOps

**Why this matters:**  
CI/CD is the foundation of DevOps. This project shows how to automate build, test, and deployment processes using Azure DevOps Pipelines.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Build a .NET or Node.js app  
- Create CI/CD pipelines with build and release stages  
- Deploy to Azure App Service  
- Add continuous integration and deployment triggers

## üß± 2. Deploy Infra with Bicep or Terraform

**Why this matters:**  
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is essential for repeatable, scalable deployments. This project teaches you to provision Azure infrastructure with code.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Write Bicep or Terraform files for VNet, App Service, and Azure SQL  
- Store IaC in version control  
- Automate deployments via pipeline  
- Understand parameterization and resource grouping

## üîê 3. Secure DevOps Starter Project

**Why this matters:**  
Security should be integrated into DevOps pipelines. This project demonstrates how to manage secrets and scan code early in the SDLC.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Connect Azure Key Vault to pipelines  
- Use variable groups securely  
- Integrate static code analysis (SonarCloud or GitHub Advanced Security)  
- Shift security left in your DevOps lifecycle

## üìä 4. Monitor a Deployed App with Application Insights

**Why this matters:**  
Monitoring is key to reliability. This project helps you track performance, availability, and failures with Azure-native tools.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Enable Application Insights for a web app  
- Connect to Log Analytics  
- Add custom metrics and alerts  
- Simulate live traffic and observe telemetry

## üß™ 5. Implement Feature Flags with LaunchDarkly or Azure App Configuration

**Why this matters:**  
Feature flags enable safer deployments and rapid rollbacks. This project explores how to decouple code releases from feature rollouts.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Configure feature flags per environment  
- Use LaunchDarkly or Azure App Configuration  
- Test progressive rollouts and A/B testing  
- Roll back features without redeploying

---

## üîÑ 6. Blue-Green or Canary Deployment Strategy

**Why this matters:**  
Minimizing downtime during deployment is crucial. This project demonstrates safe rollout strategies used in production environments.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Configure staging and production slots  
- Implement slot swapping for blue-green deployment  
- Use traffic splitting in AKS or Front Door  
- Automate controlled releases via pipelines

---

## üì¶ 7. Containerize & Deploy with ACR + Web App for Containers

**Why this matters:**  
Containers are central to cloud-native DevOps. This project walks you through building, storing, and deploying containerized applications.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Dockerize a simple app  
- Push container images to Azure Container Registry (ACR)  
- Deploy to Web App for Containers  
- Automate Docker builds and pushes via pipeline

---

## üß∞ 8. Self-Hosted Azure DevOps Agent

**Why this matters:**  
Self-hosted agents offer flexibility for custom builds, private networks, or resource-intensive jobs. This project gets you hands-on with setting one up.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Deploy and configure a VM or container as an agent  
- Connect it to Azure DevOps  
- Run builds on your custom environment  
- Manage agent pools and capabilities

---

## üìò 9. Implement Branching Strategy + PR Workflow

**Why this matters:**  
Git discipline supports team collaboration and code quality. This project reinforces modern branching strategies with PR automation.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Implement GitFlow or trunk-based development  
- Configure branch protection and PR review policies  
- Automate test/build pipelines on PRs  
- Enforce code quality with required checks

---

## üîÅ 10. YAML-Only Azure Pipeline with Multi-Stage Builds

**Why this matters:**  
YAML pipelines allow full pipeline-as-code management. This project helps you master flexible and reusable pipeline definitions.

**Hands-on skills you'll build:**  
- Define multi-stage pipelines entirely in YAML  
- Use templates, variables, and conditions  
- Automate build, test, and deploy steps  
- Eliminate dependency on classic UI pipelines

---

## ‚úÖ What You‚Äôll Walk Away With

By completing these projects, you'll gain:
- A portfolio of **real-world DevOps implementations**
- Experience with **Azure-native CI/CD, monitoring, and security tools**
